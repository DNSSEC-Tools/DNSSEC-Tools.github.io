title:  DNSSEC-Tools -- Logwatch

<h1>Logwatch</h1>
Logwatch is a popular system administration tool that collects output on a regular basis from syslog messages and summarizes them so they're easier to scan through. The DNSSEC-Tools package contains a patch to logwatch that adds support for summarizing DNSSEC related output from the <a href="bind.html">bind</a> nameserver. This patch is already included in the default logwatch base source code starting with version 7.1.
