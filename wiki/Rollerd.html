<h2>About</h2>

About.
rollerd is a daemon application that automates the process of resigning a zone on a regular basis and can automate the process of <a href="KSK.html">KSK</a> rollover using the safe and recommended practices. rollerd is designed to ensure <a href="Authoritative_Zone_Administrator.html">authoritative zone administrators</a> will not have to worry about properly performing the critical timing steps involved with updating a zone's <a href="KSK.html">KSK</a>s.

The <a href="rollctl.html">rollctl</a> command can be used to communicate with a running rollerd daemon.

<h2>Example of a rollerd Log File</h2>
