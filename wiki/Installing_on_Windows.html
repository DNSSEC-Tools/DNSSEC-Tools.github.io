Ignoring this advice and building the validator anyway....
The following assumes you want to also build the graphical tools, such as <a href="DNSSEC_Check.html">DNSSEC-Check</a>, <a href="DNSSEC_Nodes.html">DNSSEC-Nodes</a>, ...

<ol>
1. Install the <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/">QtSDK</a>
2. Install the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list?q=full+installer+official+git">windows git tools</a>
3. Get the DNSSEC-Tools source from a <a href="http://www.dnssec-tools.org/download/">tar or zip file</a> and extract it, or get a copy from <a href="git.html">git</a>
4. Get and install a copy of <a href="http://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html">OpenSSL</a>
<ul>
<li>note: If you don't have the visuall C++ 2008 redistributables package installed yet, this is a good place to get that too.</li>
</ul>
5. Get a copy of the <a href="http://www.openssl.org/source/">OpenSSL Source Code</a>.
6. start a git shell and build the dnssec-tools/validator:
<ol>
1. PATH=/c/QtSDK/mingw/bin:/c/QtSDK/msys/1.0/bin/:$PATH
2. export PATH
3. cp /c/QtSDK/mingw/bin/mingw32-make.exe /c/QtSDK/mingw/bin/make.exe
4. cd dnssec-tools/validator
5. ./configure
6. make
<ul>
<li> Note: This may fail for the applications, but it will build the libraries</li>
</ol>
</ul>
7. build the graphical applications
<ol>
1. Launch QtCreator
2. Open the APPLICATION.pro file to build in the dnssec-tools/validator/apps/APPLICATION directories.
3. Tell QtCreator to build (and optionally run) it.
4. If packaging the tools for a stand-alone run, you may need libraries from /c/QtSDK/Desktop/Qt/4.8.1/mingw/bin/ or similar
