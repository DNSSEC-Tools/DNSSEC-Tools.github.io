<h1>DNSSEC Applications</h1>
This is a brief introduction into the set of applications that have
been patched to support DNSSEC queries via the DNSSEC-Tools package.

=First Things First=

Here's how to set up your system to use the DNSSEC-aware applications.

This section must be filled in by someone who knows.

=DNSSEC-Aware Applications=

The DNSSEC-Tools project has created a number of application
patches so that they issue their DNS queries using the
DNSSEC-Tools <a href="libval.html">DNSSEC validating library</a>. This allows the
applications to trust the DNS responses it receives and to pass back DNSSEC validation error messages directly to their users.
See the three examples of how a Firefox web-browser user will see DNSSEC related messages when they visit a URL that fails DNSSEC validation
(i.e. a lookup that gives a bogus IP address).

<h2>Unpatched Firefox using a non-DNSSEC recursive server</h2>

If an unpatched browser goes to a bogus (e.g. spoofed) IP address it may end up at the wrong site and would not notice.

<h2>Unpatched Firefox using a DNSSEC supporting recursive server</h2>

Unpatched Firefox using a DNSSEC supporting recursive server.
If an unpatched browser goes to a bogus (e.g. spoofed) IP address it would not go to the bogus web site because the <a href="Recursive_Server.html">validating resolver</a> would prevent it from receiving invalid DNS data. Instead, the browser would be told there was no such host.

<h2>Patched Firefox using DNSSEC-Tool's validator library</h2>

If an application is using application level DNSSEC validation then it has the ability to more accurately display the reason behind the inability to visit a given site:

The main advantage of these patches is that the users can know why
their attempted network connections failed.

<h2>Using the Patches</h2>

Using the Patches.
With the exception of
Firefox, to use these patches, a user will have to install
DNSSEC-Tools, download the application's source code, apply the patch contained within the DNSSEC-Tools package, compile and then install the patched version of the application. The DNSSEC-Tool's download site has pre-compiled versions of the patched Firefox Fedora RPMs available.

Note:

The list of domains that require DNSSEC validation and domains that
do not require validation is configurable using libval's configuration
file, <a href="dnsval_conf.html">dnsval.conf</a>, (normally in
/usr/local/etc/dnssec-tools/dnsval.conf). This file allows an administrator to specify
which domains require validation and which trust anchors to use for
those domains. A patched application will only require validation
for the domains requiring validation as specified in the policies in dnsval.conf.

=Configuring DNSSEC Validation Policy=

When using these patches, the configuration of the DNSSEC-Tool's
libval (in <a href="dnsval_conf.html">dnsval.conf</a>) determines which sites require DNSSEC
validation, which sites don't require DNSSEC validation, and the set
of <a href="Trust_Anchor.html">Trust Anchors</a> available to use.
