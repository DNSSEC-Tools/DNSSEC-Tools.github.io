<h1>Optimize caching</h1>
<h2>Requirements</h2>

<h3>Contexts</h3>

<ol>
Requirements.
Contexts.
1. Should different applications be able to share contexts?
<ul>
<li>If yes, then we need to limit damage that can be caused to context by a misbehaving app.</li>
<li>If no, then the config file will be read each time a context is created. Also, the validator cache will not be shared between contexts: each app will have its own validator cache.</li>

</ul>
</ol>
<h3>Validator (Assertion) caches</h3>

<ol>
Validator (Assertion) caches.
1. Define new data structure
2. Should time out just like resolver caches. Free all components of the answer
3. Add API to clear cache
4. Should be indexed by "flag" also. A flag with DONT_VALIDATE gives different results.
5. Must be able to re-use validation status for synthesized positive and negative answers
6. Add bad cache support
<ul>
<li>answer from bad cache only when query failed for a certain number of times.</li>
<li>bypass the cache for getting fresh values of rrsets</li>
<li>TTL must be assigned to some small value (since this cannot be trusted)</li>
<li>answers from this cache must not be returned if the DONT_VALIDATE flag was set.</li>
<li>add support for synthesizing negative responses (ANC)</li>

</ul>
</ol>
<h3>Resolver caches</h3>

<ol>
Resolver caches.
1. Define new data structure
2. Query id spoof protection
3. Multiple threads issuing the same query should translate to a single request
4. Add API to clear cache
5. Add negative answer cache support.
<ul>
<li>indexed by name and class (since type may be missing)</li>
<li>organized by zone name, so that we get the proof from the correct zone</li>
<li>must include proofs of wildcard existence and non-existence</li>
<li>option to sythesize positive/negative answers</li>

</ul>
</ol>
<h3>Operation</h3>

<ol>
Operation.
1. Support cache-only operation
2. Support query-only (no cache) operation
