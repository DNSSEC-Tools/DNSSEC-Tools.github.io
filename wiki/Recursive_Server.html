title:  DNSSEC-Tools -- Recursive Server
---
<h1>Recursive Server</h1>
This is a brief description of the parts of DNSSEC-Tools an
administrator for a <a href="DNSSEC_aware_recursive_name_server.html">DNSSEC aware recursive name server</a> could find
useful. The server could operate on a small scale (a single machine or
small network where DNSSEC validation of DNS queries is desired) or it
could be an a large scale (an enterprise or ISP that wants to have
a DNS server supporting DNSSEC look-ups). The DNS resolver will be configured
with a list of zones that DNS results are checked for DNSSEC compliance (which could be every zone). It would do this by comparing the DNS answers and the digital <a href="RRSIG.html">signatures</a> that accompanied it. The validating resolver will continuing validating results up the DNS chain until it gets to an associated <a href="Trust_Anchor.html">Trust Anchor</a> (TA). Only after the answers have been properly validated will the server return the results to its client.

<h2>Recursive Server Administrator</h2>

Recursive Server Administrator.
DNSSEC-Tools has several tools to help
manage a validating recursive server. See <a href="http://www.dnssec-deployment.org">dnssec-deployment.org</a> and
<a href="http://www.dnssec.net">dnssec.net</a>
for information on obtaining recursive servers that support DNSSEC. Most DNS server software (and all the major ones)
support DNSSEC. 
Setting up a DNS server itself is out of scope of this
document. The DNSSEC-Tools software components <a href="trustman.html">trustman</a> and the <a href="logwatch.html">logwatch</a>
patch are most helpful with <a href="http://www.isc.org/products/BIND/">Bind</a>
software in particular. The current version of logwatch has incorperated this patch and will scan
for BIND/DNSSEC output from a Bind server. Trustman can manage Bind's <a href="named_conf.html">named.conf</a> file's <a href="Trust_Anchor.html">Trust Anchors</a> (TAs).

<h2>Logwatch</h2>
Logwatch.
The <a href="logwatch.html">logwatch</a> update patch included within the DNSSEC-Tools release is now included in current versions of Logwatch so you shouldn't need it if you are running a recent version of <a href="http://www.logwatch.org/">logwatch</a>. It
parses DNSSEC information out of 
<a href="http://www.isc.org/products/BIND/">Bind's</a> output and adds it 
to logwatch's output summary information.

<h3>Getting started with logwatch</h3>

<ul>
Getting started with logwatch.
- Obtain a version of logwatch that is at least version 7.1 or higher.
- When using it, these types of summary messages should appear in your logwatch messages if you are running BIND as a validating resolver:

</ul>
<h2>Dnspktflow</h2>

Dnspktflow.
<a href="Dnspktflow.html">Dnspktflow</a> is a tool that parses a <a href="tcpdump.html">tcpdump</a> file and graphically
displays the DNS and DNSSEC specific network traffic. It can be
used to check DNSSEC traffic at a server in order to track down or
check for errors.

<h3>Getting Started With Dnspktflow</h3>

<ul>
Getting Started With Dnspktflow.
- Given a tcpdump file called tcpdump.out with DNS traffic in it.

</ul>
<ul>
- The command line arguments above add extra information to the picture (type, query, answers, authoritative and extra information), while reducing the data to DNS packets involving hosts with 'dnssec-tools' in their names. See the <a href="dnspktflow.html">dnspktflow</a> manual page for further details.

</ul>
<h2>General Error Checking Tools</h2>

General Error Checking Tools.
For more DNSSEC error checking and debugging tools, check out the DNSSEC error checking tools summary below.
It includes general DNSSEC error checking tools as well as tools
that error check for a specific type of use or user. Some of the
tools may be useful to debugging validating DNSSEC servers.
