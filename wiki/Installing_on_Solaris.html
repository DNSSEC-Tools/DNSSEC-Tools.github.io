<h1>Installing on Solaris</h1>
Mostly solaris users should follow the more generic <a href="Installing_on_Unix.html">Installing on Unix</a> instructions, but with the following caveats:

<ul>
<li>You'll need either gcc or Sun's commercial C compiler</li>
<li>But, the default perl that comes with solaris has been compiled with Sun's commercial C compiler</li>
<ul>
<li>compiling new C-based perl modules with gcc doesn't work with the default perl</li>
<li>the only solution is to either buy Sun's commercial compiler, or install a version of perl that is compiled with gcc.</li>
