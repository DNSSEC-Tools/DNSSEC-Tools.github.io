<h1>Installing on OS X</h1>
Installing on OSX 10.6.3 (Snow Leopard)
DNSSEC-Tools 1.6 has been installed and tested on OSX 10.6.3 (Snow Leopard).
This page contains notes and comments from this installation.

The installation package used was the DNSSEC-Tools 1.6 tarball available from
http://www.dnssec-tools.org/download. After unpacking the file, the basic
DNSSEC-Tools installation inscriptions, found in INSTALL, were
followed. These notes provide amplification upon those instructions.

Perl Modules
When installing from CPAN, a number of modules gave the following sorts of
warning messages:

Even though these warnings did occur, the module tests passed. In addition,
it doesn't look like these issues have caused any problems with the
DNSSEC-Tools software.

In order to install the MailTools module, I found I had to run this
command from within cpan:

Other variations (install MailTools, install MailTools-2.06)
didn't work.

Gtk2
After building Gtk2 (within cpan), the pre-install tests resulted in
lots of errors. In particular, this error came up frequently:

However, the test itself always reported that it ran okay. In the end, I had
to run force install Gtk2.

Building DNSSEC-Tools 1.6
There were several warnings encountered during the build, most of which had to
do with string formats and incorrect library architectures.

In particular, ranlib always reported that libraries had no symbols.
However, nm showed that the libraries did have symbols.

Despite these warnings, DNSSEC-Tools 1.6 is working properly.

Perl Tk
In order to run several of the GUI-based DNSSEC-Tools utilities (e.g.,
blinkenlights, rollrec-editor, etc.), you must install the Tk modules
for Perl. This was not listed in the INSTALL directions.

It took several attempts to get Perl Tk installed.

Running DNSSEC-Tools tests
The tests in .../testing require the Text::Diff Perl module, but
this wasn't mentioned in the INSTALL file. Install this module with
CPAN prior to running the tests.

The tests ran successfully, with no errors reported.

logwatch
The URL in tools/logwatch/README is incorrect; you must get
logwatch from http://sourceforge.net/projects/logwatch.

The README lists the current logwatch version as 6.0.2, but the
README was written in 2005. The current version is 7.3.6.

I did not install nor test logwatch. When this has been done, this
page will be updated.
