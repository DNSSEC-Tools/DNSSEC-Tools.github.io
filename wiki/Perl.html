title:  DNSSEC-Tools -- Perl
---
<h1>Perl</h1>
Perl is a extensible scripting language that people either love or hate. Many of the <a href="DNSSEC_Tools_Components.html">DNSSEC-Tools Components</a> are written in perl since many supporting modules were used to base some of the software on.

Perl is available from <a href="http://www.perl.org/">http://www.perl.org</a> and <a href="http://www.activestate.com/">http://www.activestate.com/</a> for windows. Almost every operating system comes with perl installed these days (except windows).
