<h1>Trustman</h1>
Trustman implements <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5011.txt">RFC5011</a> which defines "Automated Updates of DNS Security (DNSSEC) Trust Anchors". It does this by continually running as a daemon looking for new keys published by the authoritative zones for which <a href="Trust_Anchor.html">Trust Anchors</a> (TAs) have been configured.

<h2>Trustman TODO</h2>

Trustman TODO.
This is a list of todo items for the tool:

<ul>
- TODO this was apparently not done yet: verify that getdnskeys functionality is now in trustman, especially the ability to bootstrap trust anchors
<ul>
- considering recent TAR improvements and things, this is a larger item and half of it is already done. See Wes for details.
- This was a dup: TODO Bootstrapping trust-anchors in trustman

</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
- TODO modify trustman to have to ability to migrate to a higher level trust anchor if we detect all zones between two trust anchors to be signed

</ul>
<ul>
- TODO Need to carefully test rollerd with trustman; saw some dnssec response errors in trustman while rollover operation was being performed (SNIP Workshop)

</ul>
<ul>
- TODO Trustman needs to use correct validator policy (as per dnsval.conf file) while doing validation

</ul>
<ul>
- TODO Trustman needs to be able to work with trust anchors that are encoded as DS records

</ul>
<ul>
- TODO Check revoke operation with BIND and rollerd

</ul>
<ul>
- TODO Support unbound configuration file
<ul>
- editing ability needs to be split into a separate file; see convertar details

</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
- TODO merging functions being provided by other tools (getkeys, tachk) into trustman
<ul>
- change: put into modules and make all tools use them (see convertar for module structure)

</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
- TODO should work well if a software update changes the trust anchors OOB

</ul>
