<h1>Trustman</h1>
Trustman implements <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5011.txt">RFC5011</a> which defines "Automated Updates of DNS Security (DNSSEC) Trust Anchors". It does this by continually running as a daemon looking for new keys published by the authoritative zones for which <a href="Trust_Anchor.html">Trust Anchors</a> (TAs) have been configured.

<h2>Trustman TODO</h2>

Trustman TODO.
This is a list of todo items for the tool:

<ul>
<li>TODO this was apparently not done yet: verify that getdnskeys functionality is now in trustman, especially the ability to bootstrap trust anchors</li>
<ul>
<li>considering recent TAR improvements and things, this is a larger item and half of it is already done. See Wes for details.</li>
<li>This was a dup: TODO Bootstrapping trust-anchors in trustman</li>

</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>TODO modify trustman to have to ability to migrate to a higher level trust anchor if we detect all zones between two trust anchors to be signed</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>TODO Need to carefully test rollerd with trustman; saw some dnssec response errors in trustman while rollover operation was being performed (SNIP Workshop)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>TODO Trustman needs to use correct validator policy (as per dnsval.conf file) while doing validation</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>TODO Trustman needs to be able to work with trust anchors that are encoded as DS records</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>TODO Check revoke operation with BIND and rollerd</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>TODO Support unbound configuration file</li>
<ul>
<li>editing ability needs to be split into a separate file; see convertar details</li>

</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>TODO merging functions being provided by other tools (getkeys, tachk) into trustman</li>
<ul>
<li>change: put into modules and make all tools use them (see convertar for module structure)</li>

</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>TODO should work well if a software update changes the trust anchors OOB</li>

</ul>
