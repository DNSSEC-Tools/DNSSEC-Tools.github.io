<h1>Options with Running '''rollerd'''</h1>
This is a brief description of the options available for use with running
rollerd, the DNSSEC-Tools Zone Rollover Manager.

rollerd is the zone rollover manager provided by DNSSEC-Tools. There have been
a number of optional enhancements provided since it was first introduced, such
as alternate queuing method and site-specific rollover commands. This is a
brief description of the more complex rollerd options a zone
administrator could find useful. In general, this is someone who wants to
setup and maintain one or more signed DNS zones.
