<h1>DNSSEC-Nodes</h1>
The DNSSEC-Nodes application is a graphical debugging utility that allows administrators to watch the data being logged into a libval or bind logging file.

Watch the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTtfeoaisZ8">Demonstration Video</a>!!!

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
Features.
<li>Dynamically issue DNS requests and the results will immediately update the graph</li>
<li>Display data found in log files from:</li>
<ul>
<li><a href="libval.html">libval</a></li>
<li><a href="bind.html">Bind's</a> DNS <a href="Named.html">"named"</a> daemon</li>
</ul>
<li>Filter results on the screen based on:</li>
<ul>
<li>DNS Resource Record Types (A, AAAA, ...)</li>
<li>DNSSEC Status Results (Validated, Trusted, ...)</li>
<li>By regular expression name matching ("dnssec-tools")</li>

<h2>How to Use DNSSEC-Nodes</h2>

How to Use DNSSEC-Nodes.
By default, DNSSEC-Nodes starts with only a single node: the "root"
node. As you start collecting information about other DNSSEC nodes,
the graph will expand outward from this central node.

Note: the root node is colored yellow because the trust anchor configured for it is assumed to be trusted as configured by the operator. Technically, it is not "validated" since nothing validated it.

<h3>Querying for a DNS Record</h3>

Querying for a DNS Record.
The toolbar at the bottom of the screen has a dialog box for querying
for new nodes, as well as selecting the typo to query. It also has
zoom buttons allowing you to zoom in and out from the display.

Enter a name to look up in the bottom of the box. Here are some
interesting names to try:

<ul>
<li>www.dnssec-tools.org (validated; i.e. green)</li>
<li>www.cnn.com (trusted and not validated; i.e. yellow)</li>
<li>badsign-a.test.dnssec-tools.org (untrusted/bogus; i.e. red)</li>

</ul>
Once you enter a name, hit return to see the graph updated with the
new data.

<h3>Getting the Details</h3>

Getting the Details.
If you click on any node you'll get an informational line at the top
of the display telling you the name of the node you clicked on, as
well as offering you a "Details..." button for showing additional
information. Alternatively, if you right-click on a node it'll bring
up the additional information dialog box immediately.

The "additional information" dialog box presents you with all the
details seen for the node so far. For example, here's the dialog box
for the cnn.com node:

In this case, we've noticed that the DS record provably does not
exist. This is where the tree becomes "provably insecure" and
everything beyond it can only be "trusted" (unless additional trust
anchors have been configured into the validator).

"For the Experts Note: Although this data is actually published by
the parent, the node name is registered with the child and this graph
displays data based on the name associated with the record, not based
on ownership."

The "Log Messages" tab also allows you to see the exact log messages
from the validator that were captured and decoded.

<h3>Applying Data Filters</h3>

Applying Data Filters.
DNSSEC-Nodes also lets you selectively highlight nodes of particular
interest based on:

<ul>
<li>Their DNSSEC Status (Validated, Trusted, Failed Validation, ...)</li>
<li>DNS Data Types (A, AAAA, DS, DNSKEY, ...)</li>
<li>By Name</li>

</ul>
Once you activate one of theses filters, a configuration widget is
displayed letting you further refine your filtering choices.

Here's a screen showing the highlighting of any nodes that have failed
validation. The rest of the nodes have been "dimmed" and the filtered
nodes are also raised to the top of the stack for better visibility in
cluttered diagrams.

<h3>Watching DNS Log Files</h3>

Watching DNS Log Files.
Under the file menu, you'll find menu options that will let you watch
log files and continually update the graph as new data arrives.
You'll need to configure your validating software to display the
necessary debugging data to make use of this, however, and details for
doing this can be found below.

<h4>libval</h4>

libval.
The DNSSEC-Tools validating library can be configured globally within
the dnsval.conf file (eg, /etc/dnssec-tools/dnsval.conf) by adding
lines like the following:

Then you can use the File -> Open and Watch a Log File menu item
to track what happens in this file.

<h4>bind / named</h4>

bind / named.
The bind/named software can be configured to turn on very verbose
debugging, which dnssec-nodes can then use by adding the following
lines to the named.conf file (in a section of its own; i.e., not
in the options section).

This log file can then be watched using DNSSEC-Nodes.

<h4>unbound</h4>

<h3>Preferences</h3>

<h4>Limiting The Maximum Number of Nodes Shown</h4>

Preferences.
Limiting The Maximum Number of Nodes Shown.
Using the Options -> Preferences menu, you can configure two methods of limiting the number of nodes shown on the screen. As the number of nodes gets very large you'll find the application begins to slow down. These options let you phase out the older data based on either the number of nodes collected so far, or based on time. You can either show at most "so many nodes" or limit what's on the screen based on how long ago the node's data was updated. You can turn both of these limiting factors on at the same time, as well, and the first one to trigger a node-removal will do so.
