<h1>Wget</h1>
This is a patch to enable DNSSEC validation with wget. It has been tested with wget-1.10.2 source code.

Note: Currently, This patch only works on systems that support IPv6. The local machine does not need to actually use IPv6, but the
system's TCP/IP stack does need to support IPv6 in order for the patched code to build properly.
