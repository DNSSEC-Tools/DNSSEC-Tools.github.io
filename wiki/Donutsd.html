<h2>About</h2>

About.
Donutsd is a continuously running daemon that runs <a href="donuts.html">donuts</a> on operational zone files on a regular basis. If the output of a call to donuts changes from a previous run, the administrator of the zone is emailed with an error summary. For signed zones, donutsd can automatically detect when parent child relationships break, zone signatures are nearing their expiration date, etc.
