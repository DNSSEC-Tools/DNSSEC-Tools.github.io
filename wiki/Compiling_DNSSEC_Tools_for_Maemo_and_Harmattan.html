<h1>Compiling DNSSEC-Tools for Maemo and Harmattan</h1>
<a href="Harmattan.html">Harmattan</a> and <a href="Maemo.html">Maemo</a> are very similar and thus these instructions should work for both of them. The DNSSEC-Tools download page should have recent builds for both OSes, ideally.

They both require a scratchbox build interface to be installed.
The one for <a href="Maemo.html">Maemo</a> only runs on <a href="Ubuntu.html">Ubuntu</a>, but the one for
<a href="Harmattan.html">Harmattan</a> is more generic and is known to run on both ubuntu and
<a href="Fedora.html">Fedora</a>.

The both have a curious location for the default resolv.conf. The
default one in /etc points to 127.0.0.1, as the device runs
dnsmasq. But the real dhcp assigned resolvers are stored in:

<ul>
- /var/run/resolv.conf.wlan0: when connected to the wireless network
- /var/run/resolv.conf.gprs: when connected to a cellular network

</ul>
Because of this, we have to patch libval to try one and then fallback
to the other.

Note that the resolv.conf points to the wlan0 version, but the
internal (patched) fallback will fallback to the gprs version if the
wlan0 version doesn't exist
