About NSEC records.
NSEC records are designed to prove that no records exist between two different points. As an example, here's an NSEC record from the dnssec-tools.org domain:

This record says that nothing exists between the dnssec-tools.org record and the cvs.dnssec-tools.org record exists. So if someone tries to convince you that b.dnssec-tools.org exists you can prove they're lying to you. You do need to check the <a href="RRSIG.html">RRSIG</a> signature to be sure but the important part is that it's possible to prove that someone can't insert fake records into a DNSSEC protected zone.

The problem with <a href="NSEC.html">NSEC</a> records is that it lets people find out what records do exist and thus it's impossible to hide data in a zone (which isn't recommended but people do it anyway). For example, looking for b.example.com would show you that cvs.dnssec-tools.org exists. You can actually discover the entire contents of a zone by "walking" through all the NSEC records.

<a href="NSEC3.html">NSEC3</a> records are the solution to this problem and only contain hash records of the published names instead and is supported in DNSSEC-Tools 1.5 and beyond.
