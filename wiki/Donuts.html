<h2>About</h2>

About.
Donuts is a lint-like checking tool for analyzing DNS zone files. It reports any errors it finds, either as text output if run as a command line application or in a GUI window if a error browser interface is desired.

It is extremely flexible and local rule sets and configuration can tailor its output to define local policies.

donuts is discussed in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ksgTFxAg6U">A demonstration video</a> about the DNSSEC-Tools components.

<h2>Running Donuts: using the command line</h2>

Running Donuts: using the command line.
Using the command line is simple. There are, of course, a number of options to pick from as well but the default options will suit many people.

The above loads the db.example.com file and examines it. It must be told which zone is contained within the file, which is why there is an additional argument of example.com on the command line.
Use the --level 9 flag and argument for maximum output.
