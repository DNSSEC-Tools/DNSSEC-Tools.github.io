title:  DNSSEC-Tools -- Command Line and Configuration File Loading Behaviour
---
<h1>Command Line and Configuration File Loading Behaviour</h1>
Warning: this page describes behaviour that will only be completely available in DNSSEC-Tools version 1.6 or beyond.

Many of the DNSSEC-Tools components have multiple interfaces for configuring the application and for helping users manipulate the tools.

<h2>Sources of Application Input</h2>

Sources of Application Input.
The application will take input in the following order, with later entries in the list trumping the earlier ones:

<ol>
1. Application Default Values
2. Configuration files
<ol>
1. <a href="dnssec_tools_conf.html">dnssec-tools.conf</a>
2. application specific (e.g. <a href="KRF.html">krf</a>, <a href="rollerd.html">rollrec</a>, etc)
</ol>
3. Command Line Options

</ol>
<h2>Processing</h2>

Processing.
All tools should be able to take a --dtconf command line option which will override the default location of the dnssec-tools.conf file.

<h2>Help Output</h2>

Help Output.
All tools should support -h and --help switches for displaying a command line option summary.

<h2>GUI Support</h2>

GUI Support.
Some tools may provide a <a href="GUI.html">GUI</a> window for helping users run the program without command line options. The GUI support will:

<ol>
1. Be disabled by default
2. Be launched when the --gui flag is given
3. Be launched when config file has the gui flag enabled and no options are given
<ul>
- MUST respect being launched as "APPLICATION --dtconf my.conf" as a valid starting
</ul>
4. Be launched when the DT_GUI environmental variable is configured to true and no options are given
5. Use default values in the GUI based on:
<ol>
1. Application default values
2. Configuration file contents
<ul>
-  MUST support APPLICATION --dtconf my.conf and still launch a GUI
</ul>
3. Command Line Options given
<ul>
-  (requires that "APPLICATION --gui --other-args..." be used)

</ul>
</ol>
</ol>
<h2>Transition Issues</h2>

Transition Issues.
At this time, the default values presented in the GUI come only from application configuration.

At this time, "APPLICATION --gui --other-arguments" launches the GUI without changing the default values in the GUI. It should be spitting out an error instead.

At this time, the DT_GUI environment variable doesn't work.

<h2>Implementation</h2>

Implementation.
The DTGetOptions function will implement all of the above, including:
<ul>
- Searching arguments for the --dtconf flag and reading at least the "gui" option from the pointed file to determine if a full user GUI should be launched.
