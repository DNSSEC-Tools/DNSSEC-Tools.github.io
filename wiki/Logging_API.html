<h1>Logging API</h1>
<h2>Logging Requirements from the DNSSEC-Tools</h2>

<ul>
Logging Requirements from the DNSSEC-Tools.
- allow multiple applications to use a similar output format
- allow multiple applications to use similar command line options for selecting what to log
- allow applications to prioritize a log level (eg, 1-9)
- allow applications to "tag" log strings with an indication of the content
- allow users to select what to view based on tags and priority
- allow log messages to go to any or multiple of
<ul>
- stdout/stderr
- a file
- syslog
- a callback?

</ul>
</ul>
<h2>Proposed Architecture</h2>

Proposed Architecture.
The architecture below would offer (in both perl and C):

<ol>
1. A common API for processing command line logging requests
2. An API for logging level/tags/strings/arguments from the application
<ul>
- Which would internally redistribute information
- Would filter, per destination, based on level/tags
</ul>
</ol>

<h2>Command Line Options</h2>

Command Line Options.
The current perl and C-library based command line utilities use multiple forms of CLI options. This section documents existing practice as well as how the tools can use a common API for all the commands in the future.

<h3>Current options</h3>

<ul>
Current options.
- validate, and libval, currently accept:
<ul>
- -o 7:stderr for selecting what level and where to log to
</ul>
- rollerd accepts:
<ul>
- -loglevel <level>
- -logfile <logfile>
- -verbose

</ul>
</ul>
<h3>Proposed options</h3>

<h4>--log</h4>

Proposed options.
--log.
Location ideas:

Then we need to be able to specify the level/tag options as well. ("level" below is identified via a string of numbers only).

<h3>Proposed API</h3>

Proposed API.
Ideally, our perl and C libraries should support these:

<h4>Proposed Logging API</h4>

Proposed Logging API.
 dnssec_tools_log(int level, char* tagstring, char *format_string, ...);

Example:

<h4>Proposed Selection API</h4>

Proposed Selection API.
 dnssec_tools_log_parse_option(char *string); // proceses --log options

<h3>Log Implementation Flow</h3>

Log Implementation Flow.
 dnssec_tools_log (level, tags, format_string, args...) {
