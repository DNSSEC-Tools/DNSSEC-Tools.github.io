<h1>Root key</h1>
From dnssec-deployment jabber log:

mstjohns: multiple paths: 1) In the software, 2) On the ICANN web site, 3) On the IETF web site, 4) in the setup collateral for ISPs for sold transit, 5) on the vendor web sites. Validated with: SHA1 hash, S/MIME message, ?

russ: 1) ?? 2) published by IANA 3) published in major newspaper on each continent.

olafur: IANA web site, regional registry web sites. who do people trust? maybe google. can we pay to have the correct key be the only thing that comes up when somebody uses "root key" in a query?

matt-larson: I believe there are only two official root hints distribution points: ftp.internic.net and ftp.rs.internic.net

russ: should we have a key distribution point along side of all hints file distribution points?
